## global weather testing

# description
This mini project aim was to randomly select a city name to get relevant information about the city to be tested. The first step was to randomly select a number from the YAML file. This number will be used to match with the id in the JSON file. When a match is found it will return the City name from the hash based on the matching ids. This city name is then inputted into an API which returns information about the city. This information was then tested to see if it returned correct information, for example, the correct data type.
